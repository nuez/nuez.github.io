For this project I was lead developer and product owner, working together with FrontID 
In the first phase of this project we defined and built a new, sustainable, architecture in Drupal and migrated hundreds of thousands of contents coming from LifeRay.

The original, static HTML pages of the old website were migrated to dynamic and flexible pages: site editors can now create slideshows, tabs and accordions on the fly and drag and drop them freely into the design without any requiring programming knowledge.

The site is hosted on Amazon AWS with node balancing which required the assets (images and files) to be stored on a CDN (Amazon S3). Hosting and module development for the CDN was done in collaboration with <a href="http://sbit.io/" target="_blank">SB IT Media</a>.

In the second phase we added phase we added support for satellite websites that have a different design and restricted access for designated editors. We also added a custom built Salesforce integration for contact forms.
