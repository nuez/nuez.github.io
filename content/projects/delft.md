**Drupal voor Gemeenten** (Drupal for local governments) is a Drupal installation profile for websites for local authorities. It implements proven concepts to make local goverment websites as intuitive and user-friendly as possible. The Drupal 7 version is currently used in over 30 websites for local goverments in the Netherlands. Delft is the first use case for the Drupal 8 version.

I was asked to build the port of *Drupal voor Gemeenten* to Drupal 8, while at the same time developing the specific use case of the city of Delft website.

Configuration management was particularly challenging to solve: In this case configuration belongs both to the website instance of Delft and to the modules that come with the installation profile.

It implements external services such as OWMS. On the frontend side it fully integrates the popular [Patterlab](http://patternlab.io/) library.
