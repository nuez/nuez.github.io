What started out as one of most successful holiday rental websites in the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.fijnopvakantie.nl" target="_blank">www.fijnopvakantie.nl</a>, grew out to be a full-service, hosted holiday rental solution, currently serving than 20 holiday rental websites.

The platform allows holiday park owners to increase revenue and improve conversion with a customizable, full-fledged solution taking care of bookings, processing availability (connecting to more than 10 different external booking services) and many other functionalities.

For this project I have worked on a 'full-stack' range of features: I helped professionalising DevOps and deployment strategies, built new features such as SendGrid integration and implemented new designs and elements with Angular2.

We're currenlty working on a Swagger compliant Rest API for managing bookings and reservations.
