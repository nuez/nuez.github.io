      <description>https://2017.drupalcamp.es https://github.com/AsociacionDrupalES/DrupalCampSpain https://www.lullabot.com/articles/a-successful-drupal-8-deployment  We developed the the DrupalCamp Spain website not only as a point of information for the DrupalCamp Spain 2017,but also as a blue print for future Drupal Camps and a case study for Best practices in Drupal 8. The code base is publicly accessible on Github
The website is branched off the Drupal Composer project, meaning that all dependencies can be installed using Composer (including contributed modules and core), keeping the GIT repository for the project itself clean and tidy.</description>

      <description>www.eoi.es  For this project I was lead developer and product owner, working together with FrontID In the first phase of this project we defined and built a new, sustainable, architecture in Drupal and migrated hundreds of thousands of contents coming from LifeRay.
The original, static HTML pages of the old website were migrated to dynamic and flexible pages: site editors can now create slideshows, tabs and accordions on the fly and drag and drop them freely into the design without any requiring programming knowledge.</description>

      <title>Create computed fields in Drupal 8</title>
      <link>http://nuez.io/posts/computed-fields-drupal-8/</link>

      <guid>http://nuez.io/posts/computed-fields-drupal-8/</guid>
      <description>In Drupal 7 it was possible to add computed properties to entities using a simple hook. Those properties would then become available to modules like Search API and Views. How do computed fields work in Drupal 8 and do they have the same level of maturity? 
In Drupal 8 we can distinguish between field types that have some computed properties and on the other hand fields that are fully computed.</description>

      <description>Drupal is a full-fledged CMS for secure and complex websites and applications and is adopted by many big companies and governments accross the globe. Hugo is a static site generator built in GoLang that is blazing fast and quickly gaining popularity. For this website about my Drupal work I decided to go for Hugo. Here&#39;s why.

When I started building my new portfolio website, I decided to look further than Drupal to build it.</description>
