      <description>Drupal voor Gemeenten (Drupal for local governments) is a Drupal installation profile for websites for local authorities. It implements proven concepts to make local goverment websites as intuitive and user-friendly as possible. The Drupal 7 version is currently used in over 30 websites for local goverments in the Netherlands. Delft is the first use case for the Drupal 8 version.
I was asked to build the port of Drupal voor Gemeenten to Drupal 8, while at the same time developing the specific use case of the city of Delft website.</description>

      <description>What started out as one of most successful holiday rental websites in the Netherlands, www.fijnopvakantie.nl, grew out to be a full-service, hosted holiday rental solution, currently serving than 20 holiday rental websites.
The platform allows holiday park owners to increase revenue and improve conversion with a customizable, full-fledged solution taking care of bookings, processing availability (connecting to more than 10 different external booking services) and many other functionalities.
For this project I have worked on a &amp;lsquo;full-stack&amp;rsquo; range of features: I helped professionalising DevOps and deployment strategies, built new features such as SendGrid integration and implemented new designs and elements with Angular2.</description>

      <description>For this project I was lead developer and product owner, working together with FrontID In the first phase of this project we defined and built a new, sustainable, architecture in Drupal and migrated hundreds of thousands of contents coming from LifeRay.
The original, static HTML pages of the old website were migrated to dynamic and flexible pages: site editors can now create slideshows, tabs and accordions on the fly and drag and drop them freely into the design without any requiring programming knowledge.</description>

      <title>How to build a super simple availability calendar.</title>
      <link>/posts/calendar-for-freelancers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/calendar-for-freelancers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a freelancer I like my (potential) clients to be aware of my availability, so we both don&amp;rsquo;t waste our time. To make the calendar as hassle-free as possible I wanted integrate it with Google Calendar, so all it would take is to fill in my availability there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I need is a simple view of a calendar, without details of each event: just whether or not I am available for work. I figured that the good ol&amp;rsquo; jQuery Datepicker would do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-get-an-api-key&#34;&gt;1. Get an API Key.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most of the documentation you find online about authenticating for Google APIs is about OAUTH2 and complicated authentication flows, authenticating for publicly accessible Google content is really simple: all you need is an API key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://console.developers.google.com&#34;&gt;https://console.developers.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and create a new project. Select &lt;code&gt;credentials&lt;/code&gt; and create an &lt;em&gt;API Key&lt;/em&gt;.  You can restrict the use of the key although you don&amp;rsquo;t have to. Copy the API key value somewhere: we&amp;rsquo;ll need it in our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Create computed fields in Drupal 8.</title>

      <description>In Drupal 8 we can distinguish between field types that have some computed properties and on the other hand fields that are fully computed.
The former is quite common in Drupal 8: several field type definitions have computed properties alongside other properties that are stored in the database. For example the TextItem field type stores the value and the format in the database, but a third property processed is computed on the fly: it parses the raw text value using a format resulting in the processed value.</description>

      <title>Hugo vs Drupal: Why I used Hugo for my Drupal portfolio website.</title>

      <description>Drupal is a full-fledged CMS for secure and complex websites and applications and is adopted by many big companies and governments accross the globe. Hugo is a static site generator built in GoLang that is blazing fast and quickly gaining popularity. For this website about my Drupal work I decided to go for Hugo. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
When I started building my new portfolio website, I decided to look further than Drupal to build it.</description>

      <description>We developed the the DrupalCamp Spain website not only as a point of information for the DrupalCamp Spain 2017,but also as a blue print for future Drupal Camps and a case study for Best practices in Drupal 8. The code base is publicly accessible on Github
The website is branched off the Drupal Composer project, meaning that all dependencies can be installed using Composer (including contributed modules and core), keeping the GIT repository for the project itself clean and tidy.</description>
