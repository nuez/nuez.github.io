      <description>Drupal voor Gemeenten (Drupal for local governments) is a Drupal installation profile for websites for local authorities. It implements proven concepts to make local goverment websites as intuitive and user-friendly as possible. The Drupal 7 version is currently used in over 30 websites for local goverments in the Netherlands. Delft is the first use case for the Drupal 8 version.
I was asked to build the port of Drupal voor Gemeenten to Drupal 8, while at the same time developing the specific use case of the city of Delft website.</description>

      <description>What started out as one of most successful holiday rental websites in the Netherlands, www.fijnopvakantie.nl, grew out to be a full-service, hosted holiday rental solution, currently serving than 20 holiday rental websites.
The platform allows holiday park owners to increase revenue and improve conversion with a customizable, full-fledged solution taking care of bookings, processing availability (connecting to more than 10 different external booking services) and many other functionalities.
For this project I have worked on a &amp;lsquo;full-stack&amp;rsquo; range of features: I helped professionalising DevOps and deployment strategies, built new features such as SendGrid integration and implemented new designs and elements with Angular2.</description>

      <description>For this project I was lead developer and product owner, working together with FrontID In the first phase of this project we defined and built a new, sustainable, architecture in Drupal and migrated hundreds of thousands of contents coming from LifeRay.
The original, static HTML pages of the old website were migrated to dynamic and flexible pages: site editors can now create slideshows, tabs and accordions on the fly and drag and drop them freely into the design without any requiring programming knowledge.</description>

      <description>We developed the the DrupalCamp Spain website not only as a point of information for the DrupalCamp Spain 2017,but also as a blue print for future Drupal Camps and a case study for Best practices in Drupal 8. The code base is publicly accessible on Github
The website is branched off the Drupal Composer project, meaning that all dependencies can be installed using Composer (including contributed modules and core), keeping the GIT repository for the project itself clean and tidy.</description>

      <description>For the German industrial engineering company Loesche I designed and developed a super flexible, multilingual website, using Paragraphs to guarantee maximum flexibility for the editors of the website.
The whole website was realised in just over a 100 hours including design and development.
