      <description>In Drupal 8 we can distinguish between field types that have some computed properties and on the other hand fields that are fully computed.
The former is quite common in Drupal 8: several field type definitions have computed properties alongside other properties that are stored in the database. For example the TextItem field type stores the value and the format in the database, but a third property processed is computed on the fly: it parses the raw text value using a format resulting in the processed value.</description>
