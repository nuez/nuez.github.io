      <description>We developed the the DrupalCamp Spain website not only as a point of information for the DrupalCamp Spain 2017,but also as a blue print for future Drupal Camps and a case study for Best practices in Drupal 8. The code base is publicly accessible on Github
The website is branched off the Drupal Composer project, meaning that all dependencies can be installed using Composer (including contributed modules and core), keeping the GIT repository for the project itself clean and tidy.</description>
