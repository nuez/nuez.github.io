      <description>www.eoi.es  For this project I was lead developer and product owner, working together with FrontID In the first phase of this project we defined and built a new, sustainable, architecture in Drupal and migrated hundreds of thousands of contents coming from LifeRay.
The original, static HTML pages of the old website were migrated to dynamic and flexible pages: site editors can now create slideshows, tabs and accordions on the fly and drag and drop them freely into the design without any requiring programming knowledge.</description>
